# AWS Machine Learning Specialty
## Fundamentals of Machine Learning on AWS
### Overview
* Artificial Intelligence != Machine Learning != Deep Learning
* Machine Learning - Learning from Data is = Identifying Patterns. Machine Learning Identifies Patterns in the existing data to make predications about new data.
* Deep Learning - Subset of ML.

#### When to use the Machine Learning?
* When its too difficult to code logic the "old fashioned way"using if-else statements. E.g Analyze Sentiments on the social Media data or websites.
* When its not cost effective to do it manually.
* When there is ample training data available.
* When Business problem can be stated as the ML Problem.

#### When not to use Machine Learning?
* When don't have the enough data available. E.g If we trying to predict sales for the new product.
* When Data can't be labelled.  Is the histrotical data fraud or not, will particular customer churn or not. We need to make the sense of data.
* When we need to launch quickly.
* When there is no room for error. For mission critical applications that cannot tolerate errors, ML can't be applied. 

### Defining Machine Learning Problems (Different types of problems)

### How to define the Machine Learning Problems
###  Example - Customer's Churn Problem (What Questions to ask)
#### 1. Whats the current pain point?
* Customer Churn rate last year was 14.5%.
* We have no way to predict who will leave so that we can incentivize then to stay.
#### 2. How are we currently solving this problem?
* If a customer gets angry during the service call and threatens to leave, a customer agent can offer them the incentive.
#### 3. What data do we have?
#### 4. Is the data Labelled?
#### 5. How will we define success?
* Customer Churn rate to be dropped to 4%.
* Customer retension incentives not to exceed $750,000.
#### 6. What are the trade-offs?
* Some Customers will be given incentives even if they are not Churn risks.
* Some Customers given the incentives will leave anyway.
#### 7. What is out of scope?
* Deactivaiton or downgrade of the service or features.
* Sales Experience and performance of the Customer service agents.
